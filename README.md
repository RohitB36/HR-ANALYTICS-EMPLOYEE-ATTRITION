HR ANALYSIS OF EMPLOYEE ATTRITION
Here are the tasks I undertook: 
1) Importing data from CSV file 
2) Transforming data by removing errors and being eligible for visualisation 
3) Used DAX functions for new parameters to analyse data 
4) Created a visual dashboard by using functions like charts, tables, slicers,etc. 

A few insights from the dashboard: 
1) Attrition rates are notably high  among employees who receive salary up to 5k. 
2) Age groups of 26-35 have the highest attrition rate 
3) Attrition rate is high among those who have medical and life sciences educational backgrounds. 
4) Also, employees who have completed 2, 5 or 10 years have high attrition chances.
